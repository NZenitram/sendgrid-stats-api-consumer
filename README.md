# SendGrid Consumer API Visualization

The SendGrid API Visualization application allows a SendGrid client to enter their API key into the Client ID field, select a date range, and see a visual representation of the email events that occurred on a per provider basis.

## Getting Started

To use the application, simply clone this repo onto your local machine and follow the steps below. The application is not currently deployed to a web server, but will run the same locally when the proper environment is configured.

The application does not store any user data other than temporary CSV files that are created when the API requests are made. These files do not carry any identifying information about the client, SendGrid or recipients.
